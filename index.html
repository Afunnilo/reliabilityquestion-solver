    <p class = "question-head"> Question One </p>
    <p>A life test has shown that coffeemakers fail in use at the rate of 0.04257 per month. The manufacturer
warranties that a coffeemaker will last for 12 months of ordinary usage. What is the reliability of a
coffeemaker</p>
    </div>

    <p class = "question-head">Question Two</p> 
    <p>Assume that a system is composed of five independent and identical subsystems in
series. The constant failure rate of each subsystem is 0.0025 failures per hour.
Calculate the reliability of the system for a 50-hour mission and the system mean
time to failure.</p>
     </div>
     <div class = "question">
   <p class = "question-head">Question Three</p>
   <p>A system is composed of three independent and identical subsystems. At least one
of the subsystems must operate normally for the system to work successfully.
Calculate the system’s reliability if each subsystem’s probability of failure is 0.1.</p>
   </div>
   <div class = "question">
   <p class = "question-head">Question Four</p>
   <p>5  Electric Components were subjected to stress until they failed. The observed failure times were "in 100 hours", 5.5, 6.8, 8.2, 9.1, 11.1 .
   Calculate the MTTF, Failure rate, Reliability at 1000 hours, and the time if probability of failure is 0.15</p>
   </div>
   <div class = "question">
   <p class = "question-head">Question Five</p> 
   <p>Fifteen   microswitches  were  put   on  test,  and   the  number   of   cycles until  failure counted.  (A cycle constitutes switching  a switch  on  and  then  off  again.)  After   10000  cycles  six  of  them  had  failed.  The  number  of  cycles  at  failure  were  2924,3722,4209,6039,7179,8357 Calculate  the  mean  number  of  cycles  to  failure,  the  failure  rate,  the  number  of cycles at  which  the  reliability  is 0.95 and  the  reliability  at  4000  cycles.</p>

   <div class = "question">
   <p class = "question-head">Question Six</p>
    <p>A manufacturer of a commercial televison monitor guarantees the picture tube for one year(8,760 hours). The monitors are used in airport terminals for flight schedules and they are in continuous use with power on. The mean life of the tube is 20,000 hours, and they follow an exponential time-failure density. it costs the manufacturer 300 naira to make,sell and deliver a monitor that willbe sold for 400 naira. It costs 150 naira to replace a failed tube, including materials and labour. The manufacturer has no obligation beyond the first replacement. What is the manufactuers expected profit?</p>
